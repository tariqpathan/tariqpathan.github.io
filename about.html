                            <span>However, I was certain that I wanted a career that required a strong element of problem-solving in it.</span>

                        <p class="lead"><span>Since then, over the past one and a half years I have been learning different aspects of software development, implementing them in projects whilst working as a teacher/tutor.</span>
                            <span>Throughout this process, I have been dealing with self-doubt and frustration but this has been outweighed by the reward and joy from persevering through.</span></p>
                        <p class="lead"><span>Going through this challenging process has evolved me, and I am confident in my abilities to learn, adapt and use my skills to help myself and others.</span>
